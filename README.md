[New jupyter notebook](/data_gen.ipynb) that can be run to generate additional customers with different credit cards and transactions associated with the card. This notebook should be used by googlers with a service account that has write access to the retail_banking storage bucket and the finserv_staging BQ dataset in the Looker demo project. New customers / cards are added as a table to the staging schema in BQ and the transactions are written to CSV files delimited by a pipe in google cloud storage. Requirements for running the notebook can be found here.
